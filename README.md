# WebApiAOT

This is an ASP.NET Core project made in **.NET 8** in order to be run in **Windows 7** as a proof of concept that modern .NET applications can still run in legacy operating systems.
This project uses AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation, which generates a application that starts up faster and with a small footprint.
